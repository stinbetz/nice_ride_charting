# nice_ride_charting

A simple tool that coalates Nice Ride data and meterological data.

Thank you to Nice Ride for making their data public https://www.niceridemn.org/data/
and to the MN DNR and NOAA for making historical weather data available http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/climate/historical/lcd.html?loc=msp 

`python datify.py` will generate the output .dat file and then `python chart.py` will consume the .dat file and generate
a chart.
